# Fluid Emotion
We've moved `Fluid eMotion` from the [p5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org) to glitch. Glitch works a little differently than the p5 editor. There is no need to save. While you develop your piece, changes will happen ðŸª„ immediately in the preview window to the right. Importing & Exporting is how Glitch works with git!

## What's in this project?
* `assets` â€” You can upload assets like video or audio in `assets` to the left. You need [it's URL to use in the project](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/43-how-do-i-add-assets-like-audio-images-or-videos-to-my-projects/). The maximum file size per upload is limited to 256MB.
* `README.md` â€” That's this file, we can use to document the project.
* `index.html` â€” This is the main HTML page for your site.
* `style.css` â€” a minimalist set of CSS styling rules
* `sketch.js` â€” this is our main p5 sketch
