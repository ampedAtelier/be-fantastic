# Fluid Emotion
We've moved `Fluid Emotion` from the [p5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org) to glitch. Glitch works a little differently than the p5 editor. There is no need to save. While you develop your piece, changes will happen 🪄 immediately in the preview window to the right. Importing & Exporting is how Glitch works with git!

## What's in this project?
← `assets` — You can upload assets like video or audio in `assets` to the left.

← `README.md` — That's this file, we can use to document the project.

← `index.html` — This is the main HTML page for your site.

← `style.css` — a minimalist set of CSS styling rules

← `sketch.js` — this is our main p5 sketch
