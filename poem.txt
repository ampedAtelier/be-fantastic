skin moistens, hair dampens,
wet trails down skin, down street, down dirt, into mud
erodes rock, craves destined paths
leaks spring, splatters spoil
pooling, collecting, flooding
a wave rises, cresting, crashing
overwhelming, spilling destruction 
quenching thirsts, hydrating souls
drowning lungs, gasping cries
life-giving and life-taking
with each drop
